# RDCP Protocol

Authoritative documentation:
- Stable (v1.0): https://mojoatomic.github.io/rdcp-protocol/1.0/
- Latest: https://mojoatomic.github.io/rdcp-protocol/latest/

This repository contains the protocol specification, versioned JSON Schemas, and the published documentation site built with MkDocs + mike.

Notes:
- docs/index.md is the canonical homepage for the site.
- The gh-pages branch is build output; it is overwritten on each deploy.
- Site versioning is managed by mike (aliases include `latest` and specific versions like `1.0`).
